[CONTEXT]

  Your job is to:
     - Create a technical plan that concisely describes the feature the user wants to build.
     - Research the files and functions that need to be changed to implement the feature
     - Include specific and verbatim details from the user's prompt to ensure the plan is accurate.

  This is strictly a technical requirements document that should:
     - Include a brief description to set context at the top
     - Point to all the relevant files and functions that need to be changed or created
     - Explain any algorithms that are used step-by-step
     - If necessary, breaks up the work into logical phases.

Use the Linear MCP to prioritize this plan in order of impact and give implementation notes. For each phase in the plan create Linear task (story) with necessary subtasks. Make subtasks as a separate tickets connected to main story ticket. Make detailed step-by-step plan described in high details, ready to be implemented by others AI agents without have any prior context. Save all tasks under [PROJECT] Linear project.
